# Vercel Deployment Guide for Mini Travel Diary

## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy the Mini Travel Diary application to Vercel. The application includes:
- React + Vite frontend
- Express backend
- Authentication system with Passport.js
- Diary entry management with image upload
- Map visualizations with Leaflet

## Special Configuration for Vercel

The project has been configured to handle TypeScript type checking issues during the Vercel build process. The following files are key to successful deployment:

### 1. `vercel.json`

This file configures how Vercel builds and deploys the application:
- Uses a custom build command (`vercel-deploy.sh`)
- Routes API requests to the server
- Routes all other requests to serve the frontend 
- Sets environment variables for production

### 2. `tsconfig.vercel.json`

A special TypeScript configuration for the Vercel build process:
- Extends the main tsconfig.json
- Adds `skipLibCheck: true` to bypass type checking issues
- Relaxes some type constraints during build

### 3. `vercel-deploy.sh`

A custom build script that:
- Compiles TypeScript with type checking disabled
- Builds the client application with Vite
- Ensures compatibility with Vercel's build environment

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your Vercel account to the GitHub repository
3. Configure the following environment variables in Vercel:
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: a secure random string
   - Any other environment secrets needed (Supabase, etc.)
4. Deploy the project 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter TypeScript errors during deployment:
- Check the Vercel build logs
- Verify that the custom build script (`vercel-deploy.sh`) is being executed
- Make sure all necessary environment variables are set

## Known Issues

There is a TypeScript type error in the `server/vite.ts` file related to the `allowedHosts` property. This is bypassed using our custom build configuration.
